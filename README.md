## :clipboard: Project Description
The "backend-first-project" repository is the first project of your university's backend course. It is a prototype of a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) service for a delivery service. The project has been developed using backend technologies and aims to provide a basic example of implementing a delivery service with functionalities for data creation, reading, updating, and deletion.
